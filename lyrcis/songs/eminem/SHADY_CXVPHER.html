<i>[Verse 1 - KXNG CROOKED:]</i><br>
My name is KXNG CROOKED, I snap on you rappers often<br>
When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across<br>
Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'<br>
Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention<br>
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we'll Willie Lynch 'em<br>
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground<br>
Like every bar is a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like<br>
B-b-b-b-b a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam<br>
Like god damn<br>
Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity<br>
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam<br>
Bam, bam your body drop, Van Damme, karate chop<br>
The Beretta's a better competitor<br>
Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top<br>
Killin' you and whoever in that drop top<br>
Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop<br>
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot<br>
And beaucoup, beaucoup, I'm cuckoo<br>
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku<br>
I'm worlds apart from you rappers<br>
Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic<br>
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping<br>
Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets<br>
When I come back, that's it<br>
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I<br>
When I land, you wack niggas die<br>
And your casket is your last hit<br>
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard<br>
Back to the hand clappin'<br>
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson<br>
Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan<br>
Passin' niggas with pants saggin'<br>
With their hand on a black Magnum<br>
To clap him backwards<br>
So their last words is &quot;kcuf meht nmad saggin&quot;<br>
That's backwards for &quot;fuck them damn niggas&quot;<br>
Buck them damn triggers<br>
Charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers<br>
Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive<br>
But I only like dead rappers<br>
Compare me to the best rappers who died<br>
And you rappers I used to look up to<br>
I gotta cancel you now<br>
Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex factors survive<br>
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'<br>
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightin' strike<br>
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking<br>
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'<br>
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin', I dwarf giants<br>
I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'<br>
I smoke philosophy, I snort science<br>
That means I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes<br>
That's where the fire's burnin'<br>
Try to deny music's messiah returnin'<br>
You die and you fry in my iron furnace<br>
I am on my get rich or die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis<br>
Cause I am murderous<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 2 - Joe Budden:]</i><br>
(Joe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey)<br>
Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends<br>
Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs<br>
Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims<br>
I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS<br>
But the bars there, put that on God, ask an atheist<br>
And if I ain't the bomb at least I'm in the blast radius<br>
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror<br>
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era<br>
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now<br>
Fuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now<br>
So it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit<br>
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip<br>
Face says I been stressed<br>
I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS<br>
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo<br>
Shit that bothered from the start<br>
Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart<br>
Yeah, just not the side that the beat is on<br>
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on<br>
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready<br>
These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready<br>
Not a how do I feel, not a how do I deal<br>
If that's the life, nigga, then how is it real?<br>
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers<br>
Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears<br>
But wait, wildest part of all of that is<br>
They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge<br>
But fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em<br>
House Gang, Shady, I'm gone, nigga, my job is done<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 3 - Yelawolf:]</i><br>
Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama<br>
My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama<br>
Here's the back story<br>
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb<br>
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills<br>
I don't know which one's which or what it's for<br>
Safety ain't really a habit I've formed<br>
I still smoke to the cigarette butt<br>
I still drink till I end up being that klutz<br>
Clumsy, self-destructive dummy<br>
Stumbling over my words, mumbling<br>
I'll probably do it tonight<br>
Leave the bar, leave the car<br>
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars<br>
And dream about that light that leads up to the lord<br>
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard<br>
Wake up feeling like half a human<br>
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret<br>
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community<br>
For unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity<br>
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree<br>
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne the god and Lord Jamar thought it would be<br>
Wait a minute... the lord and the god hate me<br>
Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!<br>
Nah...<br>
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree<br>
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be<br>
Wanna take a tour? Let's see<br>
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion<br>
Bucks, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers<br>
Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call<br>
Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall<br>
Lift kits, low riders, chop shops, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots<br>
Dixie flags, American flags, Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass<br>
CEO<br>
I've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit<br>
Guess who's coming to dinner?<br>
AndrÃ© 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure<br>
I've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just to pet and feed of course<br>
Who rides a horse in Nashville? I might<br>
I've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies<br>
M-80s, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket<br>
Moonshine, gold watches, gold rings<br>
All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing<br>
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style<br>
Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you<br>
I've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat<br>
All the latest CDs, mp3s, and Beats by Dre<br>
Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check<br>
I've got a black woman fine as she can be<br>
FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind<br>
A 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter<br>
I don't know where that came from<br>
I got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work<br>
Don't look under the tarp, sir<br>
I'm growin' weed for my mama there<br>
I've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley<br>
And I did it my way<br>
See, hip hop is what you make of it<br>
And I'm makin' a lot of it<br>
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 4 - Joell Ortiz:]</i><br>
But these cyphers, I treat 'em like a war, don't want no mediators<br>
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors<br>
People thank you, I do this for all the mean creators<br>
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at<br>
Now they deem me a savior<br>
But to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, man I just really like rap<br>
Y'all lucky, trust me<br>
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky<br>
With the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me<br>
Ugly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous<br>
I was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out who I really is<br>
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude<br>
I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move<br>
No rubber groove on my shoes had to fight, so suspensions<br>
I had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school<br>
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter<br>
That's a 3 and 1, I learned that in public school too<br>
Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call<br>
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done<br>
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece<br>
For this Heatmakerz beat and Brother's Keeper 1<br>
Simple mathematics, I'm addin' up to all these rap addicts<br>
I don't like to divide dough so I multiply flow<br>
And subtract maggots<br>
Like a brand new Craftmatic, boy I'm back at it<br>
Smokin' these new boys like my last habit<br>
Dabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kick's like the last dragon<br>
Hoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon<br>
I just gotta laugh cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag<br>
I'm pushin' this big ole Hearse, don't get body bagged<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 5 - Royce Da 5'9&quot;:]</i><br>
These new rappers be askin' me<br>
Why I don't be hangin' out where they be hangin' out<br>
I tell 'em, I say &quot;Lil nigga listen here&quot;<br>
If I don't got no business there, I don't got no business there<br>
See there's a difference here<br>
You hustlin' so you can be seen<br>
Nigga I'm grindin' so I can disappear<br>
I don't do it like other rappers do<br>
When it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu<br>
We got guns you only find on your cheat code screen<br>
If you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out<br>
Like Chico Bean<br>
When there's drama I don't ask no questions, I just clap in that direction<br>
I look at this gat like it's an actual accessory<br>
I'm anti-social so relax when you step to me<br>
Nigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry<br>
Your lil' stare downs won't fare well<br>
I got a pale conscience, I'm the grey area<br>
Last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman<br>
Now imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song<br>
Nigga I'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws<br>
Or run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on<br>
I'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit<br>
The only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch<br>
Glock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst<br>
Cripple your style, your first born child'll come out<br>
With a colostomy bag as the afterbirth<br>
I don't give a fuck<br>
Nigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z<br>
Stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest<br>
Lookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby<br>
Jump in the 4 door Mercedes with a .44 listenin' to JoJo and K-Ci<br>
Drinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses<br>
Maybe, this ebola for rabies<br>
That's it, just livin' the rapper life<br>
Banana clip in the air, lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight<br>
MACs, I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin' up<br>
I got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner<br>
Cause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is<br>
I'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me<br>
Mack magnet, attractin' enormous green<br>
Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack<br>
Cause this bitch is that war machine<br>
Life of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft<br>
Drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk<br>
We both got marketing plans<br>
Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before<br>
Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me<br>
And then go invest into a grocery store<br>
Rolled up with the Smith &amp; Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now<br>
I do numbers, I turn you and your crew into two plumbers<br>
Translation, get your shit together and pipe down<br>
Fuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit<br>
I'll shoot you and your sis if you insist<br>
I got my eyes on the sparrow<br>
Silencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the front of the barrel<br>
And he doin' this<br>
<br>
<i>[Verse 6 - Eminem:]</i><br>
(My name is Marshall<br>
I'm repping that motherfucking Motor City, bitch)<br>
I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet<br>
Began to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet<br>
Made shit as ill as it can get went in depth<br>
Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet<br>
I'm already covered in sweat and I wasn't even ready to come in yet<br>
AHH, let me set this drink down<br>
Beat up a gal, start beef with her pal<br>
Probably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile<br>
And &quot;Rap God&quot; was a freestyle<br>
Off the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch<br>
And I'm freestyling now<br>
I need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow<br>
It's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul<br>
Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal<br>
I need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio<br>
And went to South Beach with his talents<br>
Scream &quot;fuck you&quot; on the way out and wink with a smile<br>
This whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground<br>
But right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out<br>
Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while<br>
What the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters<br>
Bunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders<br>
One swing and you're crowned<br>
Knocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now<br>
You think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou<br>
Bitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground<br>
Reach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around<br>
Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd<br>
And heave a child in a sink hole on Cinco De Mayo<br>
When I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo<br>
Mardi Gras beads in a towel<br>
I just made that up<br>
I don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual<br>
But I'll show you a Mexican stand off<br>
Between just these two amigos<br>
Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud<br>
But I sure as fuck think I know how read body English, no doubt<br>
Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically<br>
The fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?<br>
Royce, he came up in the shit with me<br>
Never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me<br>
Let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me<br>
Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history<br>
Of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery<br>
Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning<br>
So what in the fuck is a list to me?<br>
I'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em<br>
Heck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em<br>
Ain't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out<br>
But I could put a chain around my second album<br>
And wear it as a neck medallion<br>
Became a millionaire, went downhill from there<br>
Became civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware<br>
Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career<br>
The fuck am I gonna do until then? This job is too fulfilling<br>
Two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in<br>
And a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville<br>
Into some children at the food pavilion and Build-A-Bear<br>
Warrior's mind, Iâm pro-hydrocodone euphoria<br>
In the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring<br>
I'm pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore I go four wheeler riding<br>
Gory and violent and horrifying<br>
You surely won't find no one more appalling<br>
Than I am with this retaliatorial rhyming for Gloria Steinem<br>
But I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up<br>
I usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am<br>
I guess I must've threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam<br>
When I said I could use the sample cause you's a tramp<br>
But look how you react to this trigger like<br>
When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam<br>
You're playing right in Lex Luthor's hand<br>
It's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan<br>
But fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan<br>
I'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band<br>
Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed<br>
In his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't<br>
Since honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try<br>
Try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify<br>
As a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride<br>
And say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize<br>
I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines<br>
And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds<br>
Then I'm like dollar signs<br>
But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke<br>
Is more of a knockout than Janay Rice<br>
Play nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right<br>
In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight<br>
In plain sight of the elevator surveillance<br>
Til her head is banged on the railing<br>
Then celebrate with the Ravens<br>
Never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants<br>
I'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape<br>
The aggression, rage and the anger<br>
Cause they restraints on the ankles<br>
Heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains<br>
This ain't enough to contain it<br>
But I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on<br>
Stage in a fucking negligÃ©e everyday and Liz Claiborne<br>
Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson<br>
Wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say<br>
Cause makeup ain't gonna cover<br>
That eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut<br>
Peppersprayed with your face cut<br>
Made my bank like a lay up<br>
Off these effing skanks on the way up<br>
Oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent<br>
It's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches<br>
Yes, I said seven, I measured it<br>
Seven inches from the floor<br>
While I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony<br>
At the Sheradon when I'm stretching it<br>
Bitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get<br>
So if she's hesitant to get the hint<br>
I'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with<br>
Hella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon<br>
When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench<br>
Existential detriments to a lesbian devil<br>
In the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level<br>
That separatists like a Chechnian rebel<br>
Impressionist with a pencil<br>
A pessimist, with his lips pressed against<br>
The edge of this Red Bull<br>
Pedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever<br>
You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass<br>
SHADYXV as perplexing as<br>
The last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse<br>
When I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird<br>
When I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears<br>
And these little Disney queers<br>
Who use chicks for beards?<br>
Just made that up too...<br>
Oh and the Shady 2.0<br>
We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls<br>
Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes<br>
The flows lose you as usual, so juvenile<br>
2 year old when I go to the studio<br>
It's only music but don't be foolish though<br>
You don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though<br>
In my homie's Buick<br>
Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it<br>
When I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do<br>
And I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart<br>
In one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it<br>
You couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it<br>
The day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it<br>
Rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip<br>
With the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women<br>
I'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot<br>
But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia<br>
They tryna get rid of me gadzooks<br>
But I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag<br>
Of the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through<br>
And if I catch you doing anything<br>
Hindering or prohibiting that after I give me that<br>
Tattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally<br>
Pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!<br>
<br>
Fuck it<br>
<br>
Got it somewhere in there probably
